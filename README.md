### High‑Level Components

1. **Frontend (React + TailwindCSS)** — Dashboard, live monitoring, heatmaps, and user controls  
2. **Core Scan Engine** — Static + dynamic analysis in under 400 ms  
3. **AI/ML Detector** — Anomaly detection and explainable AI reports  
4. **Blockchain Watcher** — Real-time Sei network listener, auto rescans  
5. **Data & Reporting Layer** — Findings repository, report exports, access control  
6. **Gamification & Rewards** — NFT agents, messaging, achievements, token economy  
7. **Integrations Layer** — REST API, CLI, webhooks, GitHub Actions

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Scan on Demand** — Upload a contract file or enter an address, get audit results in <400 ms.  
2. **Live Blockchain Watch** — Automatically detects new or changed contracts on Sei, triggers rescans instantly.  
3. **Alerts & Reports** — Detailed vulnerability reports with fix guidance, sent via dashboard, Slack, email, or GitHub.  
4. **Gamified Security Agents** — Vulnerabilities spawn as “monster” NFTs; agents compete to fix for rewards.  
5. **Continuous Defense** — Monitors contracts constantly for new risks or suspicious activity.

## 💻 Frontend UX Highlights

- **Dashboard-First View** — Project security posture, trends, and live events at a glance   
- **Drag-and-Drop Scanning** — Upload contract files or address lookup with instant results  
- **Severity Heatmaps** — Visual map of risks by severity for quick assessment  
- **Interactive Results Viewer** — Expand detailed vulnerabilities with CWE/OWASP links and AI patch recommendations  
- **Real-Time Monitoring View** — Track live on-chain events and rescans  
- **Integrations Manager** — API keys, webhook registration, CI/CD sample code  
- **Alerts Center** — Filter and act on critical security alerts

## 🎮 Gamification via Crossmint GOAT SDK

- **Agent Identities** — Mint NFT security agents with on-chain traits and history  
- **Vulnerability Battles** — Spawn “monster” NFTs for vulnerabilities that agents competitively fix  
- **Achievements & Leaderboards** — Automatically award badges and ranks for security wins  
- **Token Economy** — `$SENT` token rewards weighted by severity  
- **Agent-to-Agent Collaboration** — Messaging system for help requests and coordination  

```typescript
import { AgentFactory } from "@goat-sdk/sdk";
const sentinelAgent = new AgentFactory("sei").createAgent({
  name: "ThreatHunterZ",
  traits: { role: "threat_intel", detectionAccuracy: 0.94 },
  metadataURI: "ipfs://Qm.../threat-hunter.json"
});
```
