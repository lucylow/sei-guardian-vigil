## 🛡 Guardrails & Safety Framework

SEI Sentinel uses a multi-layered guardrail system for agent safety, relevance, and compliance:

- **Relevance Classifier:** Flags off-topic queries and keeps agent responses focused on blockchain security.
- **Safety Classifier:** Detects unsafe/jailbreak inputs and blocks prompt injections.
- **PII Filter:** Redacts personally identifiable information using regex and ZK-proof logic.
- **Moderation Layer:** Flags and blocks harmful or inappropriate content.
- **Tool Safeguards:** Assigns risk ratings to tools (low/medium/high) and triggers escalation for high-risk actions.
- **Rules Engine:** Blocks known threats (e.g., selfdestruct, excessive gas limits) via deterministic checks.
- **Output Validation:** Ensures agent outputs align with brand values, technical accuracy, and Sei compatibility.
- **Human Escalation:** High-risk actions require human approval via the HITL dashboard.

All guardrail decisions are logged for auditability and optimized for sub-second latency using Sei-native features.

    E --> P[Feedback Loops]
```

### 2. Principle-Specific Implementations

#### **Fairness & Bias Mitigation**
```python
class BiasDetector:
    def detect_contract_bias(self, audit_results: dict) -> bool:
        # Statistical parity across contract categories
        category_metrics = self._calculate_category_metrics(audit_results)
        return self._check_disparate_impact(category_metrics)
    
    def _check_disparate_impact(self, metrics) -> float:
        # 80% rule (Adverse Impact Ratio)
        protected_categories = ["new_devs", "small_projects"]
        for category in protected_categories:
            approval_rate = metrics[category]["approval_rate"]
            overall_rate = metrics["all"]["approval_rate"]
            if approval_rate / overall_rate < 0.8:
                return True
        return False
```

#### **Transparency & Explainability**
- **Audit Trail Contract:**
  ```solidity
  contract AuditTrail {
      struct Decision {
          address agentID;
          bytes32 contractHash;
          string vulnerability;
          string explanation;
          uint256 timestamp;
      }
      
      Decision[] public decisions;
      
      function recordDecision(
          bytes32 contractHash,
          string memory vulnerability,
          string memory explanation
      ) public {
          decisions.push(Decision(msg.sender, contractHash, vulnerability, explanation, block.timestamp));
      }
  }
  ```
- **Explainability Engine:**
  ```python
  def generate_explanation(vulnerability: dict) -> str:
      return rag_agent.query(
          f"Explain {vulnerability['type']} in plain language with Sei-specific risks"
      )
  ```

#### **Accountability**
- **Agent Identity Binding:**
  ```solidity
  contract AgentRegistry {
      struct Agent {
          address wallet;
          bytes32 publicKey;
          string role;
          uint256 reputation;
      }
      
      mapping(bytes32 => Agent) public agents;
      
      function registerAgent(
          bytes32 agentID,
          bytes32 publicKey,
          string memory role
      ) public {
          agents[agentID] = Agent(msg.sender, publicKey, role, 100);
      }
  }
  ```
- **Clear Responsibility Matrix:**

| Action | Responsible Agent | Approval Required |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Contract Block | Security Analyst | Guardrail Agent |
| Fix Deployment | Remediation Agent | Human Auditor |
| Knowledge Update | RAG Curator | Cross-Agent Consensus |

#### **Safety & Security**
- **Multi-Layer Guardrails** (as previously implemented)
- **Circuit Breaker:**
  ```python
  def system_circuit_breaker():
      if global_risk_score > 9.0:
          sei_mcp.pause_agent_actions()
          alert_human_governance()
  ```

#### **Privacy Preservation**
- **ZK-Redaction System:**
  ```python
  def zk_redact(output: str) -> tuple[str, Proof]:
      # Generate zero-knowledge proof
      proof = zk_prover.create_proof(
          statement="Output contains no sensitive data",
          witness=output,
          circuit="pii_filter"
      )
      return sanitized_output, proof
  ```
- **Data Minimization Protocol:**
  ```python
  def process_contract_data(contract: str) -> str:
      # Remove developer comments and metadata
      return re.sub(r'\/\*.*?\*\/|\/\/.*?$', '', contract, flags=re.DOTALL)
  ```

#### **Inclusiveness**
- **Gas Subsidy Program:**
  ```solidity
  contract InclusionFund {
      function request_subsidy(address developer) public {
          require(is_eligible(developer), "Not eligible");
          sei_token.transfer(developer, SUBSIDY_AMOUNT);
      }
  }
  ```
- **Multilingual Support:**
  ```python
  def localize_response(response: str, user_profile: dict) -> str:
      return deepseek_translate(
          response, 
          target_lang=user_profile["preferred_lang"]
      )
  ```

#### **Reliability**
- **SLA Monitoring:**
  ```python
  class SLAMonitor:
      def __init__(self):
          self.metrics = {
              "uptime": 0.999,
              "audit_speed": 0.4  # seconds
          }
      
      def check_sla(self) -> bool:
          return all([
              self.metrics["uptime"] >= 0.995,
              self.metrics["audit_speed"] <= 0.5
          ])
  ```
- **Chaos Engineering:**
  ```python
  def run_chaos_experiment():
      sei_testnet.simulate_network_partition()
      monitor_agent_fallback_behavior()
  ```

### 3. RAI Governance Mechanism

#### **On-Chain Governance**
```solidity
contract RAIGovernance {
    struct Proposal {
        address proposer;
        string policyChange;
        uint256 votingDeadline;
        bool executed;
    }
    
    mapping(bytes32 => Proposal) public proposals;
    
    function createProposal(string memory policyIPFShash) public {
        bytes32 id = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(policyIPFShash, block.timestamp));
        proposals[id] = Proposal(msg.sender, policyIPFShash, block.timestamp + 7 days, false);
    }
    
    function vote(bytes32 proposalID, bool support) public {
        // Voting logic with token-weighted votes
    }
}
```
